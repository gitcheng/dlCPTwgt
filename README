This program is a utility for BABAR CP/CPT analysis. It calculates event
weights in Monte Carlo events so that the weighted event distribution follows
the specified parameters that describes CP/CPT violation processes in
B0-B0bar mixing.

This program takes several arguments, including input root file name,
output file name, and CPT parameters. For detail, see

% dilCPTwgt -h
